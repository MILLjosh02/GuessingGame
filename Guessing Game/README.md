# Guessing-Game
 Short and Simple Guessing Game that will learn the longer you play the game. 
There's already a short handed binary tree that is created. 
Give it completely different answers and if it does not exist it will ask for a question to type that will get to that answer. Essentially the game will just keep growing and filling in the appropiate tree node as you keep playing the game.
